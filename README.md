paste the script into a txt file, save it as .bat in windows. (in the script file enter your password inplace of (YOURPASS). when you run the bat file first time, it will create folder Locker, put everything you want to lock in it. run the bat file. and thats it. to unlock, run the bat file again.(tested on windows 10)
